    a: "Here is where to find the upload section and how to screen a document:\n\n1. **Go to the `Desk` Tab**: At the top navigation bar, click the **`Desk`** tab (the first tab on the left).\n2. **Step 1 — Traveller Intake**: Enter the traveller's Name, Nationality, and Purpose of Travel (e.g. Tourism, Trade), then click **Start Traveller Session**.\n3. **Step 2 — Document Intake (Upload Section)**:\n   - Located right in the middle under **`Step 2: Document Intake & Optical Scan`**.\n   - Select the **Document Type** (Passport, Aadhaar, PAN, Driving Licence, Voter ID, Nepali Citizenship).\n   - Drop your files into the **`Side A (Front / Bio Page)`** and optional **`Side B (Back / Address Page)`** boxes, or click **Browse Files**.\n   - Alternatively, click any button in the **Specimen Quick-Picker** on the right (e.g., *Genuine Passport*, *Forged PAN*) to test with instant samples without uploading files!\n4. **Inspect & Decide**: The system instantly runs the 4 modules in under 800ms.

    a: "**SSB Border Screening (SIH26188)** is an enterprise AI-powered fake identity and document screening console built specifically for the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) and Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) border checkpoint inspection desks (Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan frontiers).\n\nIt enables screening officers to upload physical or digital identity documents (Passport, Aadhaar, PAN, Driving Licence, Voter ID / EPIC, Nepal Citizenship, Bhutan ID) along with an optional live face capture. The engine runs a **4-Module Forensic Pipeline** in under 800ms, computing an explainable Risk Score (0–100) and automated verdict (**CLEAR**, **REVIEW**, or **FLAGGED**). All operations adhere to **Zero-Raw-Storage** privacy (DPDP Act 2023) and generate court-admissible audit chains (BSA 2023 Section 65B).",

    q: "Explain the Four-Module Forensic Screening Pipeline.",
    a: "The screening desk evaluates every traveller document through four isolated, deterministic, and AI-assisted modules:\n\n1. **Module 1 — Multi-Pass Optical Extraction (M1)**: Extracts textual fields, MRZ zones, and UIDAI Secure QR codes using RapidOCR (ONNX), PyTesseract, and 4-way rotation scans with EXIF transpose.\n2. **Module 2 — Document Validation & Checksums (M2)**: Performs mathematical checksum verification (ICAO 9303 Doc 731 weights for passports/visas, Verhoeff algorithm for Aadhaar, state RTO series for Driving Licences, ITD category checks for PAN), expiry rules, and privacy-preserving hashed watchlist matches.\n3. **Module 3 — Document Forensics & Tamper Detection (M3)**: Executes image forensics including JPEG Error Level Analysis (ELA), 2D-FFT spectral Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) for print-scan forgery, and Photo-Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) sensor noise correlation for spliced portrait detection.\n4. **Module 4 — Biometric Facial Verification (M4)**: Detects face crops on the document and compares them against live webcam frames using 512-dimensional face embeddings with cosine similarity, age-aware thresholding, and interactive challenge-response liveness (blink, head nod).",

Our system enforces **Zero-Raw-Storage by design**:\n- **Ephemeral In-Memory Processing**: Uploaded images and live camera frames exist only in volatile memory during pipeline execution and are zeroed immediately after.\n- **Masked Persistence**: The database stores only masked fields (e.g. `****1234`, `A****G`, `*** Nayak`) and deterministic SHA-256 cryptographic hashes.\n- **Zero Plaintext Logs**: Application logs and structured telemetry never print raw document numbers or holder names.\n- **Privacy-Preserving Watchlist**: Watchlist entries store only `SHA-256(normalized_id)` + search reason.",
