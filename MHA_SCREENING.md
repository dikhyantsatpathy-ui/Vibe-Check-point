# SIH26188 — AI-Based Fake Identity & Document Screening (MHA) — BUILD STATUS / HANDOFF

> **Status: DONE** — the four PS modules are built, Aadhaar is fully stripped,
> the old "No Cap" provenance/ledger engine (sign/verify/blockchain/IPFS) has
> been **removed entirely**, follow-on screening capabilities are integrated,
> the suite is green (95 tests), and the console is a single screening view.
> This file is the accuracy-grounded twin of `frontend/src/knowledge.ts`
> (which cites `MHA_SCREENING.md` as its source). Update it whenever the desk
> changes so the next agent can trust it.

## 1. THE PROBLEM STATEMENT (source of truth — do not regress)

**SIH26188 — "AI-Based Fake Identity & Document Screening System"** —
Ministry of Home Affairs, Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), Police II Division.
Software · Miscellaneous. A **border-checkpoint document screening tool**.
The PS explicitly requires FOUR modules:

- **Module 1: OCR Extraction** — auto-extract fields from identity/travel
  documents (Passport, National ID, Driving Licence, permit documents).
- **Module 2: Document Validation** — verify extracted info against official
  document standards (check digits, format rules, checksums, expiry) and
  validate against rules + databases.
- **Module 3: Tampering Detection (core AI)** — detect digitally or physically
  altered documents: **Photo Replacement, Text Manipulation, Stamp Forgery,
  Image Metadata Analysis.**
- **Module 4: Face Verification** — document owner vs the presented person
  (live frame vs document portrait).

Expected impact accepted as the yardstick: seconds instead of minutes,
standardized screening decisions, a **risk score** for border staff, and a
**digital trail** for investigations. Expired/blacklisted documents and
identity impersonation must be caught.

> WARNING: public SIH scraper text contains a garbage "Expected Solution" line
> about "monitor and manage police assets" — a scrape artifact from a different
> PS. Ignore it. The four modules + risk score + digital trail ARE the criteria.

## 2. THE REPO — ONE CONSOLE, ONE SOUL

Repo `D:\mos\crypto`. FastAPI backend in `app/`, single-file React bundle in
`frontend/src` compiled to `app/static/index.html` (Vercel serves that
bundle). Windows/PowerShell environment — see §11.

The repo **is** the identity-document screening desk: the four modules below,
orchestrated by `run_screening`, behind a Google-SSO officer console. The old
"No Cap" provenance engine (media signing, broadcasts, ledger, blockchain
anchoring, IPFS, public verification, analytics) was deleted from the backend,
frontend, migrations, and this documentation in the latest pass — do not
resurrect it.

## 3. WHAT IS DONE (git history)

- `9d8394a` **feat: SIH26188 4-module screening desk** — built the four
  modules, deleted mock registries (`verification_providers.py`) and DigiLocker
  (`digilocker_provider.py`), removed the `/api/identity/*` route suite,
  refreshed the frontend desk, migrated the DB (masked screening rows only).
- `a88f01a` **feat: drop Aadhaar/UIDAI/QR-crypto** (pushed to `origin`)
  — full Aadhaar strip per user directive ("completely
  lean into the direction for SIH"): removed the Aadhaar doc type, the
  Aadhaar-SecureQR `crypto_mode` toggle, the `UIDAI_AADHAAR_PUBKEY_PEM` env
  var, the Verhoeff checksum, QR decode / QR-portrait plumbing, and the
  orphaned `IdentityCheck` DB model.
- Integrated SIH follow-on batch (present in the working tree and verified
  below): SQLite tuning plus reporting indexes; spectral/PRNU tampering
  signals; Visa validation; serial plausibility; travel-validity status;
  Devanagari/Latin name divergence; cross-checkpoint syndicate alerts; signed
  shift export; and a tamper-evident printable dossier. Integration hardening
  removed silent third-party OCR egress, runtime face-model downloads,
  unused QR/Aadhaar packages, and an unused declared-merge variable.

## 4. LOCKED DECISIONS (as-built, supersede any earlier plan)

1. **Aadhaar is OUT.** No Aadhaar doc type, no crypto toggle, no UIDAI key, no
   Verhoeff, no QR decode, no QR portrait. (Earlier plan "keep both crypto
   paths with a toggle" is **superseded** — the user explicitly dropped it.)
2. **No fake registries, no DigiLocker.** Both provider files are deleted
   along with all `IDV_*` / `DIGILOCKER_*` env vars. The only "database
   lookup" is the honest **SHA-256 hash-only watchlist**.
3. **Doc-type scope:** verify deterministically, demystify the invigilators —
    **Passport** (ICAO 9303 TD3 MRZ check digits), **Visa** (MRZ-backed number
    agreement plus TD1/TD2/TD3 checksums), **Driving Licence** (format rules),
    **PAN** (structure + PAN check-character), **Voter-ID/EPIC**
    (format). Anything else = format rules only, no fake "REGISTERED" claims.
4. **Digital trail = plain DB audit** — masked `ScreeningReport` rows +
   watchlist + opener attribution + supervisory adjudication. Supervisors can
   additionally export a SHA-256-signed shift CSV or open a printable
   HMAC-sealed dossier. Screening rows keep a vestigial `ledger_status`
   column (always `LOCAL`) — a leftover field, not a ledger.
5. **Zero-storage and no silent egress:** raw bytes/text/photos are read,
    used, discarded. DB stores only SHA-256 hashes, masked identifiers, and
    explainable signals. OCR stays local: if tesseract is unavailable, OCR
    honestly reports off instead of sending a document image to a cloud OCR
    service. Face matching uses only an explicitly configured local ONNX model
    and never downloads model weights during screening.
    MRZ zero-storage: passport validation folds the extractor's already-validated
    check digits in via `fields["mrz_valid"]` when no MRZ text is handed on.

## 5. THE PIPELINE — four thin modules (1:1 with the PS)

Orchestrated by `run_screening(db, data, filename, doc_type, checkpoint,
declared_map, screener=..., live_frame=...)` in `app/screening.py`. Response
gains a `modules` section (extraction/validation/tampering/face) beside the
existing report contract.

| Module | File | Entry point | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 extraction | `app/extraction.py` | `extract_document(data, filename, doc_type, declared)` | pdf→pypdf text layer→`extract_fields` (identifier regexes + MRZ); scanned PDFs fall back to embedded-image OCR. `declared` back-fills gaps, never shadows machine-read values, and is scoped by document type so an unrelated declared key cannot populate another identifier field. Output `{medium, fields, mrz, ocr, pdf_no_text}`. |
| M2 validation | `app/validation.py` | `validate_document(doc_type, fields, declared=None, mrz_text="", watchlist_hits=None)` | deterministic `{label, ok(True/False/None), detail}` checks per type (MRZ check digits, passport/visa agreement, PAN structure/check-char, DL/voter format, serial plausibility, expiry), plus the hash-only watchlist fold-in. `ok=None` = "inspect by eye", never a silent pass. |
| M3 tampering | `app/tampering.py` | `tamper_analysis(image_bytes, ai_detection=None, ...)` | aggregates `forensics.ela` (+ face-zone crop), `image_qa`, ROI zone boxes, 2D-FFT spectral periodicity, sensor-noise/PRNU consistency, metadata/EXIF fingerprints into named checks; returns `{verdict, checks, ela, roi}`. **Photo Replacement / Text Manipulation / Stamp Forgery / Metadata Analysis** all surface here as named checks. |
| M4 face | `app/face.py` | `face_verification(document_bytes=None, live_frame=None, doc_type="")` | document face ROI (from module 3 zone boxes) vs live webcam frame via `face_match.compare_faces`; `{score, match T/F/None, method, detail, checks, verdict}`. Missing live frame / no face ROI degrades to honest "UNVERIFIED / confirm by eye". |

Supporting engines (unchanged, reused): `app/mrz.py` (ICAO 9303 TD1/TD2/TD3,
`compute_mrz_check_digit`, MRZ = also visas), `app/forensics.py` (ELA,
`image_qa`, `roi_boxes`, liveness signals, `verify_webcam_liveness`),
`app/face_match.py` (dHash via Pillow — works on Vercel — + optional
`FACE_EMBED_MODEL` ONNX), `app/yolo_roi.py`, plus the AI/ML content
provenance inlined in `app/main.py` (heuristic / Sightengine / self-hosted
ONNX detector — the old `app/detectors` package was folded in).

`app/identity.py` is now **slim**: deterministic validators
(`verify_pan`, `verify_dl`, `verify_rc`, `verify_epic`, `verify_passport`,
`verify_visa`), serial plausibility (`serial_plausibility`), `ocr_extract`,
`_resolve_number`/`_extract_source_number`, `_pan_check_char`.
No Aadhaar / QR / crypto / `build_identity_report`.

`app/syndicate.py` compares the current masked screening against recent
screening rows for identity clashes, cross-checkpoint reappearance, prior
flags, and checkpoint bursts. `app/transliterate.py` provides dependency-free
Devanagari→Latin transliteration plus Levenshtein name matching.

`app/screening.py` helpers: `norm`, `mask`, `sha256`, `mrz_checkdigit`,
`_parse_date`, `_first_date`, `extract_mrz`, `extract_fields`,
`_match_identifiers`.

**Two separate `_FIELD_FOR` maps are intentional:** `validation.py` maps
rc→`driving_licence` (screening field keys); `identity.py` maps rc→`rc`
(declared-doc map). Do not "simplify" one into the other.

## 6. RISK ENGINE & REPORT CONTRACT

- Risk starts at **20**; module verdicts then fold in (each module is also
  explained in plain-language `reasons`):
  - M2 a deterministic check failed → **+25**
  - M3 a tampering/anomaly check failed → **+14**
  - M4 face mismatch → **+40** (strongest single signal)
  - Watchlist hit → **+60** ("reroute to a supervisory officer")
  - Declared expiry in the past fails through Module 2 and the existing
    expired-document signal; expiry within 180 days produces an
    `EXPIRING_SOON` travel-validity status and **+6**.
  - A hard MRZ/declared name divergence adds **+18**; an inconclusive name
    check below 0.60 similarity adds **+6**.
  - Syndicate signals add their bump: identity clash **+35** per conflicting
    name/DOB, cross-checkpoint reappearance **+25**, previously flagged
    identifier **+20**, checkpoint burst **+10**.
  - Other signals: AI-suspected content, JSON-wrapped media, metadata issues,
    date inconsistencies etc. in the ±3…±30 band.
  - Floor: if risk ≤ 30 and coverage < 0.4 and nothing identified →
    **forced to 34** (never CLEAR on an empty evidence base).
- Clamped 0–100; verdict = `_grade`: **CLEAR / REVIEW / FLAGGED**; confidence =
  `min(0.98, 0.45 + coverage*0.5)`.
- Report gains `travel_validity` (`status`, `days_to_expiry`,
  `six_month_rule`, `age_at_crossing`, `detail`) and `syndicate_alerts`.
  `modules.extraction` = `{ran, medium, mrz, ocr, document_aware}`;
  `modules.validation` = `{verdict, checks}`; `modules.tampering` =
  `{verdict, checks, ela{status,damage_ratio,mean_diff,latency_ms},
  heatmap_b64, overlay_grid, roi}`; `modules.face` = verdict + match + checks.
- Persisted `ScreeningReport` row keeps the queue/adjudication/watchlist flow.
  Adjudication (supervisory CLEAR/FLAG + note) is part of the digital trail.

## 7. ROUTES (`app/main.py`)

Screening family (all live, verified): `POST /api/screen`,
`GET /api/screen/queue`, `GET /api/screen/reports/{report_id}`,
`POST /api/screen/reports/{report_id}/adjudicate`,
`GET /api/screen/watchlist`, `POST /api/screen/watchlist/add`,
`POST /api/screen/watchlist/remove`, `GET /api/screen/shift-export`,
`GET /api/screen/syndicate-alerts`, `GET /api/screen/dossier/{report_id}`.

`/api/screen` form fields: `file`, `live_frame` (optional webcam blob),
`doc_type` (default `"other"`), `checkpoint`, `declared` (JSON map). **No
`crypto` field** — Aadhaar mode is gone.

Operational reporting routes require an admin session: shift export is
supervisor-only and returns masked rows plus a SHA-256 digest; the dossier
route returns a printable HTML report with an HMAC-SHA256 custody seal
(master key derived). Do not describe the dossier as legally
admissible in any jurisdiction — the code proves integrity, not legal
admissibility.

Deleted (do not resurrect): `/api/identity/meta`, `/api/identity/verify`,
`/api/identity/registry-check`, `/api/identity/liveness/verify`,
`/api/identity/forensics/ela`. `main.py` no longer imports from
`identity` for reports. Stray `IdentityCheck` class + `identity_checks`
table model removed from code (live table row relic harmless).

Admin/chat routes are untouched and now the only non-screening surface:
`/api/chat`, `/api/admin/*`. The sign/verify/ledger/analytics/network/stats
routes were deleted — watch-if-you-touch.

## 8. FRONTEND (`frontend/src/`, ships as `app/static/index.html`)

- `views/AuthorityView.tsx`: the **ScreeningDesk is the single screen-desk
  UI** — upload (pdf/image), doc-type select (`SCREEN_DOC_TYPES` =
  pan/passport/visa/driving_licence/voter_id/other; default **passport**),
  checkpoint, per-type declared-number placeholder, optional **"capture live face"**
  (webcam blob → `live_frame`), result card with a 4-pill scorecard, M1–M4 module panels + per-check tone
  (`MODULE_VERDICT_TONE`), travel-validity badge, syndicate banner,
  ELA heatmap overlay, court-dossier link, queue, shift-export button,
  adjudication, and hash-only watchlist. No crypto toggle.
  Adjudication metadata is merged into the displayed full report so the queue
  detail endpoint cannot wipe modules, reasons, travel, or syndicate sections.
- `api.ts`: `screenDocument(file, docType, checkpoint, declared?, liveFrame?)`
  builds the multipart form; `ScreenModuleExtraction` has `ocr`/`mrz` but **no**
  `qr_payload_present`; `ScreenModuleValidation` has **no** `crypto_mode`.
  Added `getSyndicateAlerts()` and `getDossierUrl()` helpers.
  `SCREEN_DOC_LABELS`, per-type placeholders, `SCREEN_WATCHLIST_CATEGORIES`
  (`pan/passport/visa/driving_licence/voter_id/phone`), and
  `ScreenTravelValidity` keep the desk aligned with the backend validators and
  the identifier families actually checked by the hash-only watchlist.
- `app/explain.tsx` + `knowledge.ts`: chatbot/explain copy updated — no Aadhaar,
  screening described as passport/visa/DL/PAN/voter-ID with ICAO 9303 MRZ checks,
  plus syndicate, travel-validity, dossier, and shift-export behavior.
- `npm run build` = `tsc --noEmit && vite build` (singlefile) → regenerates
  `app/static/index.html`.

## 9. DB MODELS (`app/main.py`)

`ScreeningReport` (masked fields, checks, signals, risk/verdict/confidence,
adjudication), `WatchlistEntry` (**identifier_hash + reason only**),
`SignerIdentity` (officer roles, super-admin). Reporting indexes cover
screening verdict and `(checkpoint, created_at)`; SQLite-only connections use
WAL/normal-sync/busy-timeout/cache pragmas. The old ledger/verification
models (`LedgerBlock`, `VerificationLog`, `PendingUpload`,
`SightengineUsage`) are deleted. Migrations run at startup; the migration
startup was fixed to run each statement in its own transaction (~5s import)
— do not reintroduce a single outer transaction.

## 10. ENVIRONMENT (`app/main.py` reads via os.environ)

Core: `DATABASE_URL`, `MASTER_VAULT_KEY`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`,
`ALLOWED_DOMAINS`/`ALLOWED_EMAILS`/`SUPER_ADMINS`,
`KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL`, `GEMINI_API_KEY` (chat only — never OCR fallback),
`FACE_EMBED_MODEL` (face_match; unset → Pillow dHash whole-image; never
auto-downloaded). **Removed:** the Web3/IPFS vars
(`WEB3_RPC_URL`, `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`, `PINATA_JWT`,
`BLOCKCHAIN_EXPLORER_URL`) and all `IDV_*`,
`DIGILOCKER_*`, `UIDAI_AADHAAR_PUBKEY_PEM`. See `.env.example`.
`onnxruntime` remains worker-only/commented, and removed `zxing-cpp` plus
`pyaadhaar` because no screening code imports them.

## 11. CONVENTIONS / GOTCHAS (read before editing)

- **Windows PowerShell 5.1.** Use full cmdlets, single-quoted strings,
  `select/Select-String`, `curl.exe`; write temp scripts for `python -c`.
- **`app/` is not a package.** Lazy cross-module imports inside functions only
  (`screening ↔ main`, `extraction→screening`, `face→face_match`,
  `validation→identity`); `screening.run_screening` imports the ORM models
  inside the function. Import cycles are the #1 trap.
- **Tesseract is NOT on Vercel.** `ocr_extract` degrades to `{ran: False,
  reason: "tesseract not installed"}` — that is the intended honest path; the
  desk still works off PDF text layers, MRZ, and declared fields. Do not add a
  cloud-OCR fallback without an explicit privacy/security decision.
- **Face model:** leave `FACE_EMBED_MODEL` unset in prod (whole-image dHash)
  unless you also install `onnxruntime` on the worker. Face code never
  downloads weights; tests assert that no model download occurs.
- **Screen-report `ledger_status`** is a vestigial column that always reads
  `LOCAL` — screening is not chained. Do not remove the column from the model
  (migrations/indexes reference it); the UI shows it as `record: LOCAL`.
- Auto-format line endings: do not hand-edit `app/static/index.html`.

## 12. TEST & SHIP RECIPE (proven green in this integration)

```
python -m pytest -q            # 95 passed
python -m pyflakes app/... tests/...   # zero warnings (do not pass requirements.txt)
cd frontend && npm run build   # regenerates ../app/static/index.html
git add -A && git commit -m "..." && git push origin main
```

Remote: `origin` = https://github.com/dikhyantsatpathy-ui/NO-CAP---SIH.git
Live `/api/screen`
requires an admin session cookie (anonymous POST → `{"detail":"ACCESS DENIED:
Missing or invalid secure session cookie."}`). Tests: `test_screening.py`,
`test_identity.py` (validators, OCR no-egress, no Aadhaar), `test_syndicate.py`
(including dossier/syndicate endpoints), `test_mrz.py`, `test_forensics.py`
(spectral/PRNU), `test_face_match.py` (including no-download),
`test_detectors.py`, `test_auth.py`, `test_codebase.py`.

## 13. THE DEMO STORY — "how do I believe it?"

At a checkpoint an officer uploads a document (passport/visa/DL/PAN/voter-ID),
optionally a live webcam frame, and in seconds gets, in plain language:
(a) M1 fields extracted, (b) M2 validity per official standards — **check-digit
math fails when one digit flips**, (c) M3 tampering signals with an **ELA
heatmap**, spectral periodicity, and sensor-noise consistency checks,
(d) travel-validity status and M4 face-match verdict,
(e) cross-checkpoint syndicate alerts and a **watchlist hit flagged
instantly without ever storing the raw identifier**, all landing in a masked
audit row with a 0–100 **risk score** + CLEAR/REVIEW/FLAGGED + supervisory
adjudication, printable dossier, or signed shift export.

## 14. OPEN IDEAS (not built — conscious yays/nays)

- **Syndicate tuning:** current thresholds and 50/200-row history windows are
  operational heuristics, not calibrated fraud models. Tune false-positive
  behavior before relying on bursts/clashes in live operations.
- **Cloud OCR on Vercel** for image-only passports remains intentionally absent
  to avoid third-party PII egress; local tesseract remains the only OCR path.
- **SCRFD face detection/alignment** before embedding (the current ONNX engine
  resizes whole images to 112x112; a detector improves real-world accuracy) —
  the face-match integration runs ArcFace today; detection is a future
  refinement.
